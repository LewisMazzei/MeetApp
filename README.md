# SmoothServe

Web app that allows waiting staff to take down an order on a mobile device and then submit it to the bar and kitchen displays. Table orders are displayed as info cards containing the ordered items and the time since they were ordered. Card accent changes colour as the time hits certain intervals. Then allows the bar/kitchen staff to ‘complete’ the order, remove it as a card and displaying the number at the top of the display before finally allowing the staff to remove it from the display completely when the table has paid the bill.
